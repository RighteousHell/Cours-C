
Deep in a sewer dungeon under stone

And all for nothing it had ever done

Except forget to go in fear perhaps.

A number in. But what about the brook

How else dispose of an immortal force

If from its being kept forever under,

With the new city street it has to wear

The meadow grass could be cemented down

From growing under pavements of a town;

Is water wood to serve a brook the same?

That held the house as in an elbow-crook?

No one would know except for ancient maps

That such a brook ran water. But I wonder

And impulse, having dipped a finger length

And made it leap my knuckle, having tossed

No longer needed? Staunch it at its source

In fetid darkness still to live and run --

The thoughts may not have risen that so keep

This new-built city from both work and sleep.
I ask as one who knew the brook, its strength

The apple trees be sent to hearth-stone flame.

A flower to try its currents where they crossed.
